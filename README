INTRODUCTION

	This script plots a map of the denied hosts from the denyhosts daemon. It first reads out the contents of the /etc/hosts.deny file, after which every IP address in this file is checked for geo location. Afterwards, a .KML file is created with the GPS coordinates of every entry. The KML file can be imported into Google Earth or http://maps.google.com.

EXAMPLES

	An example output can be found here; http://g.co/maps/qt3tz

INSTALL

	The script has been tested under Debian and Ubuntu. Clone the Git repository and run the denyhosts_map.sh script with a regular user account. The generated KML will appear in your current directory.

usage: "$ ./denyhosts-map.sh [<inputFile> <outputFile>] | [? | h | help | usage]"

With no args, '$DEFAULT_INPUT_FILE' will be used as the input file,
and '$DEFAULT_OUTPUT_FILE' will be used as the output file (defaults are
set at the top of the file, currently to "/etc/hosts.deny" and
"$PWD/map.kml" respectively.
